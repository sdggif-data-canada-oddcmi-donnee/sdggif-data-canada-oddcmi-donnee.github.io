They cover a broad range of social, environmental and economic issues, including but not limited to poverty, hunger, health, education, social equality, innovation, climate change, biodiversity and justice, with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind.” Countries are also encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that can include country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieving the SDGs.\n\nStatistics Canada’s Role in The SDGs\nStatistics Canada is a trusted producer of high-quality, robust, impartial statistical information to support SDGs. Working in partnership with government departments, the private sector, NGOs and international organizations, we have been actively engaged internationally and domestically to support the measurement of SDGs.\n\nIn this role, Statistics Canada is responsible for the following:\n\n\n  Measuring, reporting, and disseminating Canada’s progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals;\n  Maintaining and improving the Global Indicator Framework and Canadian Indicator Framework data hubs;\n  Exploring new ways to work with traditional and non-traditional partners, to examine new sources of data, and to develop new and innovative ways to meet data users’ needs through the provision of tools and guidance related to the development of high-quality information;\n  Building and strengthening partnerships with governmental colleagues, NGOs, civil-society groups, the private sector, and international organizations to identify and address data gaps.\n\n\nAbout This Data Hub\nStatistics Canada is the focal point for measuring and reporting Canada’s progress on the Sustainable Development Goals for the Government of Canada. As such, Statistics Canada developed this interactive data hub using the Open SDG platform to disseminate Canada’s progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nStatistics Canada continues to examine data sources that may be useful for reporting on the indicators and will continue to add further data disaggregation, statistics, and data visualization features to enhance the experience of users over time.\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team would like to thank everyone that participated in the quality assurance, made suggestions for improvement or contributed in any other way to the creation of this hub.\n\nInterested in more information?\nIf you have further questions or would like to provide feedback on the SDG Data Hub, please contact us.

This includes new data as well as updates to data already published. We will continue to incorporate data from existing sources whenever possible.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\n\nWe currently use four types of reporting status:\n\n\n  Reported online: Data or information are available to report on this indicator. However, data may not be available for all requested disaggregation at this time.\n  Exploring data sources: Statistics Canada has not yet found any suitable data sources to report on this indicator. Please contact us if you have any suggestions.\n  Not available: No data is available to report on this indicator.\n  Not applicable: This indicator is not applicable within the Canadian context.\n\n\nWhy are some indicators classified as proxies?\n\nAn indicator is classified as a proxy when it contains some alternative data or methodology to those specified by the United Nations (UN). The indicator presented is the most suitable match currently available. Detailed information regarding the differences between a proxy indicator and its corresponding United Nations indicator can be found in the respective indicator’s page.\n\nWhat types of data disaggregation are available?\n\nStatistics Canada strives to provide a comprehensive picture of progress by leveraging disaggregated data, where available. As such, data sources are evaluated and selected based on their suitability to report on each indicator and their potential to provide a granular level reporting.\n\nFor example, socioeconomic indicators are typically disaggregated by geography and sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, and other population characteristics where available. If data permit and it is relevant for the reporting, indicators are also disaggregated by characteristics such as household characteristics, Indigenous identity, immigrant status and racialized groups, to name a few.\n\nOn the other hand, environmental and economic indicators are typically disaggregated by geography, type of economic activity, business characteristics or industry, for example.\n\nWhat is the tier classification for the global indicators and what does each of the tiers mean?\n\nTo facilitate the implementation of the Global Indicator Framework, all indicators are classified into three tiers based on their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level.\n\nEach SDG indicators are assigned to one (or more) of the following tiers:\n\n\n  Tier I: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.\n  Tier II: Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.\n  Tier III: No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.\n\n\nFor more information, please consult the IAEG-SDG Tier Classification for Global Indicators.\n\nHow accessible is this website?\n\nOur aim is to make this website as accessible and usable as possible for every user. The Open SDG platform has recently achieved the AA level standard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1).\n\nWhat browsers can I use to view this website?\n\nOur website works with most of the latest versions of the commonly used browsers. There are some issues with using the site on older versions of browsers (such as IE8) and the Open SDG team is working to fix these.\n\nCan other countries copy this website?\n\nYes. This site is built using the Open SDG platform, which is an open source, free-to-reuse platform for managing and publishing data and statistics related to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

At its heart, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people globally can enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\nThe goals are underpinned by a framework of global indicators that allow Canada and other countries to monitor and report on progress. They cover a broad range of social, environmental, and economic issues with a focus on the most vulnerable and a commitment to “leave no one behind”. To complement the global goals, countries are encouraged to develop a national implementation plan that focuses on country-developed indicators to address specific national contexts and priorities to achieve the SDGs.\n\nTo support the Government of Canada’s commitment to a domestic implementation of the SDGs, a national strategy has been established. In addition, the development of a Canadian-specific indicator framework was an opportunity to elaborate on the UN goals with a set of indicators that align more closely with Canada’s domestic priorities in sustainable development.\n\nMeasuring Progress\nMeasuring and monitoring progress with reliable information is key to understanding how a country advances towards the achievement of the SDGs.\n\nClosely monitoring the progress of each indicator not only shows where a country is making progress or falling behind, which helps to better focus its efforts, but also communicates how the country is performing in an open and transparent manner. A robust measure of progress quantifies an indicator’s progress towards reaching the target in a scientific manner and can be used as a tool to better understand success of policies and actions taken to achieve those targets. It can also act as a clear signal to decision-makers to readjust or develop effective evidence-based policies to help ensure the country achieves its targets.\n\nMethodology Adopted\nThe Global Indicator Framework (GIF) lays the foundation for Canada and all other countries to measure and report their progress towards the 17 SDGs. The GIF divides the 17 SDGs across 169 targets and 234 unique indicators, all of which were agreed upon and are measured consistently by all United Nations Member States. The Canadian Indicator Framework (CIF) focuses on Canadian priorities for sustainable development and can be considered a complement to the GIF. The CIF complements the 17 SDGs with 33 ambitions and 86 indicators that are specific to Canada. Across the GIF and the CIF, indicators may have defined quantitative targets (e.g., GIF 1.2 and CIF 1.1 both target a 50% reduction of the poverty rate according to national definitions), aspirational targets (e.g., CIF target 5.3 Greater representation of women in leadership roles), or no target at all.\n\nTo complement the GIF and the CIF, Statistics Canada has developed a robust and simple method of measuring progress which can be reported using visualizations that allow data users to easily see areas of progress or weakness. Even in the absence of specific quantitative targets, an estimate of progress can inform whether undesired trends are being observed by reporting progress deterioration. In essence, this measure of progress provides a simplified illustration of Canada’s progress towards achieving the SDGs, assuming that the current trends are maintained.\n\nRequirements\nStatistics Canada identified essential requirements for the adopted methodology. The guiding principle for the methodology was the necessity of a consistent and easily interpretable measure that could reach a broad audience while maintaining scientific integrity.\n\nMore specifically, the methodology must:\n\n\n  Allow for different data periodicity and timeliness: Data series available in Canada have various collection calendars and reference periods. Some are collected every year while others are collected every few years. Furthermore, the time required between the collection of data and release of official statistics varies greatly between programs.\n  Provide a calculation for measuring progress in the absence of a quantitative target: To gain a greater understanding of policy impacts and progress towards the achievements of the SDGs, it is crucial to be able to assess progress in the absence of a specific numerical target.\n  Allow for the calculation of an aggregate measure, whether at the target, ambition, or goal level: When used appropriately, a composite measure of progress is valuable to leaders and policymakers to help steer policy and actions towards making progress to achieve the SDGs.\n\n\nThe adopted methodology cannot rely on:\n\n\n  The need to create a target when there is none. As a statistical agency, we remain politically neutral. Therefore, it is outside the scope of our mandate to assign targets. Thus, the methodology must be valid even in the absence of a target.\n  Indicator-specific thresholds for progress categories: It was assessed that using different criteria for each indicator would put too much emphasis on the method rather than the message and overall progress. Therefore, the methodology developed uses a straightforward and consistent method across all indicators.\n  The existence of extended time series: Many issues covered in the SDGs haven’t been measured for an extended period. Opting for a methodology that is robust despite a shorter time series allows for a considerable increase in the number of indicators for which progress can be calculated.\n  Modelling: Similar to item 3, modelling usually requires a longer time series which will reduce the number of indicators eligible for calculation of the progress measure.\n\n\nMethodology\nThe progress measure consists of a measure of observed growth compared to an evaluation of the proximity to achieving the target under current conditions. In situations where no quantitative target is provided, the time series is evaluated on the apparent trend of the data.\n\nKeeping in mind the limited number of data points in each time series and a desire to keep the methodology simple and transparent, the optimal methodology for measuring progress was inspired by the progress methodology used by Eurostat.1\n\nProgress is measured using the growth over the observed period and is calculated by a compound annual growth rate,\n\n\n\nwhere\nCAGRi is the observed compound annual growth rate between t0 and ti,\nyi is the value of the indicator at time ti,\nti is the most recent year where data is available,\nt0 is the base year, 2015, unless otherwise specified, and\ny0 is the value of the indicator in the base year.\n\nIndicators with quantitative targets\nIn the case where a quantitative target for the indicator is provided, the observed CAGRi is compared to the magnitude of the theoretical CAGRT, which represents the annual growth rate that would be required to achieve the target on time, by calculating the ratio (R) as follows:\n\n\n\nwhere\n\nyT is the target value of the indicator in the target year, tT, and\nd is +1 when the desired progress is in the positive direction and -1 when the desired progress is in the negative direction.\n\nThis formula represents the ratio of the observed growth rate compared to the growth rate required to reach the target while accounting for certain edge cases where the direction to the target differs from the desired direction of progress (e.g., some cases where the base value achieves the target).\n\nThe result is compared against a set of thresholds2 and assigned a progress category as described in the table below:\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Ratio of observed over required growth rate\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    Target is achieved\n    Target achieved\n    \n  \n  \n    R &geq; 95%\n    On track\n    \n  \n  \n    60% &leq; R &lt; 95%\n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    0% &leq; R &lt; 60%\n    Limited progress\n    \n  \n  \n    R &lt; 0%\n    Deterioration\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nIndicators without quantitative targets\nIn the case where no quantitative target for a given indicator has been provided, the observed compound annual growth rate is compared to predetermined fixed growth rates while also accounting for the desired direction of progress.\n\n\n\nThe thresholds are described in the table below:\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Observed growth rate\n    Category\n    Symbol\n  \n\n\n  \n    CAGR &geq; 1.5% C&ast;\n    On track\n    \n  \n  \n    0.5% C&ast; &leq; CAGR &lt; 1.5% C&ast;\n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    \n  \n  \n    0% &leq; CAGR &lt; 0.5% C&ast;\n    Limited progress\n    \n  \n  \n    CAGR &lt; 0%\n    Deterioration\n    \n  \n\n\n*The scaling factor C is only applied for indicators with natural limits as defined below. It is a variable between 0 and 1 that reduces thresholds greater than 0% to produce more realistic progress assessments near limits.\n\nIn some cases, indicators may have natural maximum or minimum limits. For example, CIF indicator 9.4.1 Proportion of Canadians that have access to the latest generally deployed mobile wireless technology cannot exceed a maximum limit of 100%. If the value of the indicator in the base year is already near the natural limit, it may be impossible to achieve the growth rates required to attain a progress status of “On track” or “Progress made but acceleration needed” without exceeding the maximum limit of 100%. In these cases, the growth rate thresholds presented in the table are scaled down by a factor that accounts for the base value y0 and natural limit ylim of the indicator. Progress thresholds greater than 0% are reduced by a factor of\n\n\n\nwhere the first case (0 ≤ y0 &lt; ylim) covers situations with a maximum limit and the last two cases cover situations with a minimum limit. The scaling factor, C, is a variable between 0 and 1 that reduces the progress thresholds according to the proximity between the base value and the limit. If the base value is very close to the limit, C will be near zero and will aggressively reduce the thresholds to allow a more realistic range of progress assessments. Alternatively, if the base value is far from the limit, C will be near 1 and will have a minimal impact on the final progress assessment for the indicator.\n\nThe scaling factor defined above was chosen to optimally reduce the progress thresholds in a way that (1) ensures the possibility of attaining a progress status of “On track” without exceeding the limit throughout the first 15 years,3 (2) ensures the reduction factor is identical at equal relative distances from a minimum or a maximum limit, and (3) poses a minimal effect on the thresholds used at intermediate values and those values far away from the limit.4\n\nOnly a limit that affects progress in the desired direction is considered. For example, a maximum limit is not considered for indicators whose desired direction of progress is negative. Also, the scaling factor is not applied to thresholds less than or equal to zero (thresholds ≤ 0%), which represent movement in the inverse direction from the desired direction of progress.\n\nAggregated progress status\nIn some instances, an indicator may not have an explicit headline series or may be composed of many sub-indicators of equal importance. For example, CIF indicator 5.3.1 Proportion of leadership roles held by women provides an assortment of data series for women in various leadership positions. In these situations, the trend of each series is considered in making a final progress assessment for the indicator as a whole.\n\nTo do so, the progress value (R for indicators with quantitative targets and CAGR for indicators without quantitative targets) for each relevant series is converted to a score. The score is obtained from a linear transformation of the progress value to a score that ranges from -5 for indicators showing substantial deterioration to +5 for indicators showing substantial progress (see Figures 1 and 2). The score range is divided equally between all four progress categories: scores between 2.5 and 5 belong to the “On track” category, scores between 0 and 2.5 belong to the “Progress made but acceleration needed” category, scores between -2.5 and 0 belong to the “Limited progress” category, and scores between -5 and -2.5 belong to the “Deterioration” category.\n\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;\n  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-fymr{border-color:inherit;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Symbol\n    Category\n    Score\n  \n\n\n  \n    \n    Target achieved\n    5*\n  \n  \n    \n    On track\n    [2.5, 5]\n  \n  \n    \n    Progress made but acceleration needed\n    [0, 2.5[\n  \n  \n    \n    Limited progress\n    [-2.5, 0[\n  \n  \n    \n    Deterioration\n    [-5, -2.5[\n  \n\n\n*Only applicable for indicators with quantitative targets. Indicators that achieve the target are automatically assigned a score of 5 regardless of the underlying trend.\n\nFor indicators without quantitative targets, the cut-off thresholds are 2% for a score of +5 and -2% for a score of -5 as illustrated in Figure 1 below. If applicable, thresholds greater than 0% are reduced by the scaling factor C to maintain consistency between scores for indicators with a limit and indicators without a limit.\n\n\n  Figure 1. Score transformation for indicators without quantitative targets\n  \n\n\nFor indicators with quantitative targets, the cut-off thresholds are 130% for a score of +5 and -60% for a score of -5 as illustrated in Figure 2 below.\n\n\n  Figure 2. Score transformation for indicators with quantitative targets\n  \n\n\nThe mean of the progress scores from each series is taken as the overall progress score for the indicator. The aggregate progress status is determined directly from the overall progress score according to the defined ranges of each progress category. For example, the aggregate progress status for an indicator with an overall score of +1 is “Progress made but acceleration needed”.\n\nAny series that achieves its target is automatically assigned a progress score of +5. However, all series must achieve the target for the aggregate progress status to be “Target achieved”.\n\nSub-indicator grouping\nIn rare cases, sub-indicators may be reported via multiple series (sub-sub-indicators). In this situation, the progress scores from each series grouped within the sub-indicator are determined and averaged together before passing along the group’s mean score to be used in the next steps of the aggregate progress calculation of the indicator. For example, GIF indicator 1.4.1 Proportion of population living in households with access to basic services is composed of many sub-indicators covering access to different forms of basic services. Each basic service should be accorded equal weighting in the determination of the progress score for this indicator. However, the Access to basic education sub-indicator is itself composed of multiple sub-sub-indicators that cover a range of age groups and subjects. Therefore, the progress scores from each available sub-sub-indicator are grouped together and averaged, resulting in a single mean progress score for the Access to basic education sub-indicator. The mean of the progress scores from each sub-indicator (where some of the sub-indicators’ scores may themselves be the result of an averaged group of sub-sub-indicator scores) then becomes the final aggregate progress score for the indicator. Grouping depth is not limited. This grouping method guarantees that sub-indicators are weighted equally when assigning a progress status to the indicator.\n\nConsiderations and Exceptions\n\nSpecial considerations for the base value and the target value\nThe progress measurement methodology uses an exponential model to evaluate the growth rate of an indicator observed to date against various thresholds. As an exponential model, it cannot handle cases where either the base value or the target is zero. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the following replacements are performed automatically:\n\n  If the target value is zero, it is replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.\n  If the base value is zero, it is replaced by 0.001 in the calculation of the progress measure.\n\n\nGenerally, care should be taken to manually select an appropriate replacement value. For example, a target of zero could be replaced by a suitably small number like 1 or 0.001, but the latter is a factor of 1000 smaller than the former, which could significantly impact the final progress assessment.\n\nAnother special consideration for the base value comes when it is exactly equal to the natural limit (y0 = ylim) of an indicator without a quantitative target. In this case, the scaling factor C will be exactly zero, meaning all progress thresholds greater than 0% will be reduced to zero as well. In such a situation, if the calculated progress value is zero or greater (CAGR ≥ 0), the current value is maintained at the limit (or may even exceed the limit) and a progress status of “On track” as well as a score of +5 are assigned to the series. However, if the calculated progress value is negative (CAGR &lt; 0), the progress score and status can be determined as usual.\n\nSpecial considerations for the base year and the target year\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted in 2015 to catalyze progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. As such, the base year is assumed to be 2015 and the target year is assumed to be 2030 unless specified otherwise. Even when the target results from a policy that was implemented after 2015, the base year will be 2015 when data exists unless otherwise specified. This approach ensures coherence and comparability across assessments, in alignment with Statistics Canada’s dimensions of data quality.\n\nShould there be no available data for 2015, the first available year following 2015 will be used. In very few cases where the periodicity of the data is over 4 years or more, a base year of 2014 may be used instead. Additionally, if the reference period spans multiple years, the first year is used as the reference period. For example, the reference period 2015-16 is interpreted as the reference year 2015 in the progress calculation.\n\nMinimum data requirements\nThe data must meet certain requirements in order to produce a progress assessment.\n\n  At least two years of data is required to calculate the progress measure.\n  As the described progress measure methodology is based on an exponential growth model, it is valid only when all values are positive or all values are negative. If all values are negative, the desired direction of progress is flipped in the progress measure calculation.\n\n\nWhen the data for an indicator does not meet these minimum requirements, the progress status will be reported as “Unable to assess”.\n\nIn rare cases, when the relevant experts have determined that a progress assessment would hinder the interpretation of the indicator data, the progress status will instead be reported as “Not available”.\n\nBinary indicators\nBinary or non-statitical indicators are categorized as follows:\n\n  “Target achieved” if all conditions for meeting the target have been met.\n  “Target not achieved” if one or more conditions for meeting the target have not been met.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe progress assessments generated by the outlined methodology oversimplify reality. The methodology may produce better results when applied to indicators demonstrating a trend of continuous exponential growth year after year than when applied to other types of indicators. Results for indicators where the base value or the target value is zero should also be interpreted carefully due to the limitations of the underlying model. Importantly, it takes time for policies to yield measurable results. Users should interpret the reported progress status accordingly, alongside any other relevant contextual information.\n\nSpecific exceptions for Canada’s Global Indicator Framework reporting\nTo overcome certain limitations of the progress measurement methodology, data may be transformed into an equivalent valid form before calculating progress. Such transformations are intended to enable consistent progress measurements across a greater number of indicators.\n\nGoldilocks indicators\nFor some indicators, it is desirable to approach and meet the target, but exceeding it may have negative consequences. We have labelled indicators with these types of targets as “Goldilocks” indicators because being far above the target is “too cold”, being below the target is “too hot”, while achieving the target is deemed “just right”. The results improve as we approach the target and worsen as we move away from the target in either direction. The methods used to address this type of target are described below:\n\n  GIF indicator 4.5.1 Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintile and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated: The observed parity index value, yi, is compared to the ideal parity index value of 1. To ensure that inequities in either direction are handled fairly and equally, the observed parity index value and the ideal parity index value are compared through a ratio of one to the other. In other words, the observed values are transformed as max(yi, 1⁄yi), which corresponds to selecting whichever is larger between the ratio of the observed value to the ideal value of 1 and the reciprocal situation. Therefore, a group performing twice as well as another is measured equally to the reciprocal situation, in which a group performs half as well as the other. The desired progress is a reduction of the transformed value towards a target of 1. Furthermore, if the observed parity index value is between 0.97 and 1.03, the transformed value is simply taken to be 1 since it falls within the accepted range for parity.\n  GIF indicator 5.4.1 Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, by sex, age and location: The stated target of promoting “shared responsibility within the household and family” is interpreted as meaning the time spent on unpaid domestic and care work for men and women should be equal. As such, this indicator’s data is transformed into a measure of the ratio of the time spent on unpaid domestic and care work between men and women and assessed similarly to GIF indicator 4.5.1. The transformed value used in subsequent progress calculations is whichever is larger between the ratio of women to men and the ratio of men to women: max(fi⁄mi, mi⁄fi ), where fi represents the observed time spent by women on unpaid domestic and care work and mi represents the observed time spent by men on unpaid domestic and care work. The desired progression is a reduction towards a target ratio of 1. However, a reduction in the total time spent on domestic and care work from all genders may not be the desired outcome as it may indicate growing neglect rather than gender equality. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the progress of this indicator.\n  GIF indicators 5.5.1 Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments, 5.5.2 Proportion of women in managerial positions, and 5.a.1(b) Share of women among owners or rights-bearers of agricultural land, by type of tenure: Progress can be assessed by taking the absolute difference between the observed proportion, yi, and the target of 50% (gender equality), or abs(yi - 50%). Absolute differencing allows imbalances in either direction (e.g., more women in managerial positions or more men in managerial positions) to be interpreted as equally undesirable in the progress assessment. To avoid complexities that would result from zero values, we can force the absolute difference to be between 50% and 100% by transforming the observed value as 50% + abs(yi - 50%). This transformation is equivalent to reflecting any values below the target to equidistant positions on the other upper side of the target. The desired progress is a reduction of the transformed value towards a target of 50%.\n  GIF indicator 8.5.2 Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities: Low unemployment is generally a positive economic indicator, signalling more job opportunities, higher wages, better working conditions, reduced government welfare spending, and increased tax revenue. However, extremely low unemployment rates risk negative economic outcomes as finding and retaining workers becomes more difficult and rising inflationary pressures may become significant. Thus, many economists support a natural rate of unemployment that balances good employment opportunities and inflationary pressures. To note, the natural unemployment rate may vary between countries. A natural unemployment rate of 3% is assumed and the desired progress is a reduction towards this 3% target. Due to the complex consequences of extremely low unemployment, no progress status will be produced if the unemployment rate falls below the 3% target.\n  GIF indicator 16.6.1 Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget, by sector: A responsible government is expected to spend according to its approved budget, while not exceeding or failing short of the approved amount. Prior to the progress calculation, the values for this indicator can be transformed to account equally for both over- and under-spending. Similarly to GIF indicators 5.5.1, 5.5.2, and 5.a.1(b), the transformation adds the absolute difference between the observed proportion and the target to the target of 100% as follow: 100% + abs(yi - 100%), where yi is the observed proportion. This transformation ensures that the desired progress is a reduction of the transformed value towards 100%, reflecting any proportion below the target to its equivalent position above the target. Due to unpredictable outcomes below 25%, progress will not be measured in extreme situations that fall below this threshold.\n\n\nUnit transformations\nThe methodology is not applicable to indicators that allow both negative and positive values, such as indicators measuring percent change or growth rates. When possible, the values for these types of indicators should be transformed into unit types that are compatible with the progress measurement methodology before performing the progress calculations. In the GIF, this transformation may be applied to measure the progress of the following indicators and series:\n\n  GIF indicator 8.1.1 Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita\n  GIF indicator 8.2.1 Annual growth rate of real GDP per employed person\n  GIF indicator 10.1.1 Growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita among the bottom 40 per cent of the population and the total population\n  GIF indicator 11.3.1 Ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate\n  GIF indicator 15.2.1 Progress towards sustainable forest management, Series: Annual forest area change rate (%)\n\n\nAdditionally, GIF indicator 15.5.1 Red List Index is reported by Canada via a proxy indicator specifying the cumulative percent change of the Canadian Species Index since 1970. Cumulative percent change values are unsuitable for the described progress measure methodology because both positive and negative values are allowed. Therefore, the progress measure is calculated by first transforming the indicator data to an equivalent valid form. The base value in 1970 can be set to 1 and the following years’ values are converted by applying the cumulative percent change to this base value. For example, in 2015, the cumulative percent change since 1970 was -6.61%, so 1(1 - 0.0661) = 0.9399 is taken as the value for 2015 in the progress measure calculation. The desired progress is an increase of the transformed value as there is no quantitative target for this indicator.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe progress measure methodology described above is applied throughout Statistics Canada’s Data Hubs for the SDGs. At a glance, users can interpret indicator-level progress towards Canada’s sustainable development goals!\n\nStatistics Canada’s SDG team is working with the Open SDG community to integrate the indicator-level progress measurement into the back-end of the Open SDG platform. The official release of the progress measurement functionality is coming soon with the launch of Open SDG 2.4.0.\n\nPlease contact us if you have any questions or want to know more about Statistics Canada’s progress measurement methodology for the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMetadata\n\nGlobal Indicator Framework\nThe table below provides the targets and desired directions used by Statistics Canada to measure Canada’s progress across the GIF. All targets are interpreted at the country-level.
